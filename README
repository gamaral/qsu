Configuring
===========

    "./configure" will bootstrap the build directory for you, or you can do it
    manually if you like living on the edge.

    If you're using CMake, a few settings are availble in the cache (QSU_*),
    you can change them around by running: make edit_cache

    Otherwise, when using qmake, you can simply copy the supplied config.h.def
    and change to your hearts content.

Installing
==========

    make install (as root)
